# SEBAS
SEBAS – Simply Elegant Bookmarked Alternatives for commandS

To design a CLI tool like SEBAS in Rust that meets your requirements, here’s a comprehensive approach:

---

### 1. **Core Design Goals**
- **GNU Compatibility**: Ensure the CLI adheres to GNU standards for consistency and familiarity.
- **Simplicity**: Keep commands concise and intuitive.
- **Flexibility**: Support nested `.sebas` folders with command inheritance.
- **Optional GUI**: Provide a simple GUI for users who prefer a visual interface.
- **JSON Storage**: Store commands in a structured JSON format for easy parsing and extensibility.

---

### 2. **Sub-Commands Interface Design**
Here’s a suggested structure for your CLI commands:

#### **Core Commands**
- **Add Command**: `sebas a <COMMAND> [--group GROUP] [--comment COMMENT]`
  - Adds a command to the nearest `.sebas` folder.
  - Example: `sebas a "git commit -m 'Initial commit'" --group "Git" --comment "Standard commit"`
- **List Commands**: `sebas ls [--group GROUP]`
  - Lists all commands (optionally filtered by group).
  - Example: `sebas ls --group "Git"`
- **Edit Command**: `sebas e <COMMAND_INDEX> [--new-command COMMAND] [--new-group GROUP] [--new-comment COMMENT]`
  - Edits an existing command.
  - Example: `sebas e 1 --new-command "git status" --new-comment "Check git status"`
- **Remove Command**: `sebas rm <COMMAND_INDEX>`
  - Removes a command by its index.
  - Example: `sebas rm 1`
- **Search Commands**: `sebas s <QUERY>`
  - Searches commands by keyword.
  - Example: `sebas s "commit"`

#### **Folder Management**
- **Init Folder**: `sebas init [PATH]`
  - Creates a `.sebas` folder at the specified path (defaults to current directory).
  - Example: `sebas init`
- **Sync Folders**: `sebas sync`
  - Syncs commands from nested `.sebas` folders to the home folder.
  - Example: `sebas sync`

### 3. **JSON Structure**
Here’s an example of how commands could be stored in JSON:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "git commit -m 'Initial commit'",
      "group": "Git",
      "comment": "Standard commit",
      "folder": "/home/user/project/.sebas"
    },
    {
      "command": "docker build -t my-image .",
      "group": "Docker",
      "comment": "Build Docker image",
      "folder": "/home/user/.sebas"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 4. **Optional GUI**
An optional GUI could be built using a library like `egui` or `iced`. The GUI would:
- **List Commands**: Display all commands with their groups and comments.
- **Add/Edit Commands**: Provide a form for adding or editing commands.
- **Search**: Include a search bar to filter commands.
- **Sync**: Add a button to sync nested `.sebas` folders.

---

### 5. **Implementation Tips**
- Use `clap` for parsing CLI arguments in Rust.
- Use `serde_json` for JSON serialization/deserialization.
- For GUI, consider `egui` for simplicity or `iced` for more customization.

Here’s a JSON structure for storing commands in SEBAS (Smart Embedded Building Automation System). Each command can include details such as the command name, description, parameters, and execution details.

```json
// SEBAS Command JSON Structure

{
  "commands": [
    {
      "commandName": "TurnOnLight",
      "description": "Turns on the light in a specified room.",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "parameterName": "roomId",
          "description": "The ID of the room where the light is located.",
          "type": "string",
          "required": true
        }
      ],
      "execution": {
        "action": "setLightState",
        "args": {
          "roomId": "${roomId}",
          "state": "on"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "commandName": "SetTemperature",
      "description": "Sets the temperature for a specified room.",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "parameterName": "roomId",
          "description": "The ID of the room where the temperature will be set.",
          "type": "string",
          "required": true
        },
        {
          "parameterName": "temperature",
          "description": "The desired temperature in Celsius.",
          "type": "number",
          "required": true
        }
      ],
      "execution": {
        "action": "setThermostat",
        "args": {
          "roomId": "${roomId}",
          "temperature": "${temperature}"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "commandName": "LockDoors",
      "description": "Locks all doors in the building.",
      "parameters": [],
      "execution": {
        "action": "lockAllDoors",
        "args": {}
      }
    }
  ]
}

```


This JSON structure provides a flexible way to define commands in SEBAS, including their parameters and execution details. You can expand or modify it based on the specific requirements of your system.

This CLI structure outlines the main commands and options available in SEBAS for interacting with blockchain systems.Here's what I've put together for you so far for your SEBAS CLI tool:

---

### **Key Accomplishments:**
1. **Sub-Command Interface Design:**
   - Designed a comprehensive and intuitive sub-command structure that is GNU-compatible, concise, and user-friendly. 
   - Examples of key commands include:
     - Add Command: `sebas a <COMMAND> [--group GROUP] [--comment COMMENT]`
     - List Commands: `sebas ls [--group GROUP]`
     - Edit Command: `sebas e <COMMAND_INDEX> [--new-command COMMAND]`

2. **JSON Storage Structure:**
   - Developed a structured JSON format for saving SEBAS commands with metadata like group, comments, and folder location. This ensures your commands are well-organized and future-proof.
   - Example Structure:
     ```json
     {
       "commands": [
         {
           "command": "git commit -m 'Initial commit'",
           "group": "Git",
           "comment": "Standard commit",
           "folder": "/home/user/.sebas"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **Optional GUI Suggestions:**
   - Provided a plan to implement an optional GUI using Rust GUI frameworks like `egui` or `iced` to visually manage commands. Features include adding, editing, listing, and searching commands within the `.sebas` folders.

4. **Implementation Help:**
   - Suggested libraries for Rust development that will simplify your work:
     - `clap` for argument parsing:wa
     - `serde_json` for JSON handling
     - `egui`/`iced` for GUI development

---

### **Pending/Next Steps:**
- **Detailed Implementation:** While the design and ideas are in place, specifics on how each command would interact with nested `.sebas` folders or the GUI design can be expanded further.
- **Feedback Loop:** Confirm the design and JSON structure align with your vision or if modifications are needed. For example, a deeper dive into features like command sharing across systems or syncing logic could be explored further.
